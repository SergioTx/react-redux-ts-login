# React Redux Ts Login

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the Typescript template. Prettier was also added as a formatter.

The project uses React, Redux and Typescript.

It consists of a login page and a dashboard with 2 pages: secret-dashboard and settings. All the data is stored inside Firebase and all the data is protected by the credentials.

More info about the app can be found in the SOLUTION.md file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
